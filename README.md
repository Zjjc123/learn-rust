# Highlights

## Types

-   Statically typed, must know type at compile time
-   Compiler can usually infer type from usage

## Variables

-   Default immutable
-   Make mutable with `mut`
-   Holds primitive data or references to data
-   Can shadow variables by declaring variables with the same name (can change type)

## Ownership

-   Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner
-   There can only be one owner at a time
-   When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped (`drop` is called)
-   Assigning a value to another variable moves ownership (no shallow copies)
    -   Only one pointer to a piece of data

## References

-   References allow us to refer to a value but not own it
-   & the ampersand syntax let us create a reference
-   The action of creating a reference is called "borrowing"
-   References are immutable by default
-   Can make references mutable with the mut keyword `&mut`
-   Can only have one mutable reference to a piece of data at a time
-   Cannot have both mutable and immutable references (either some number of immutable reference(s) or a single mutable reference)
-   Compiler guaranteees that references will never be dangling

## Slices

-   Create a slice by specifying [starting_index..ending_index]
-   Slices store a reference to the first element and a length
-   String literal are slices (of type &str)

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
```

## Structs

-   Create custom meaningful types
-   Associated pieces of data and can name each piece

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}
```

## Associated Functions (Methods)

-   Can define functions that associate with type with the `impl` block
-   Methods are associated function that have self as their first parameter
-   Associated functions without self are of ften used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct
-   Rust has a automatic referencing and dereferencing

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

## Modules

-   Rust treats files and subfiles as modules and sub-modules
-   Cannot reference files directly with simple imports
-   Need to create a tree of modules (similar to barrel export in javascript)
-   Use the `mod` keyword to include a module and `pub` keyword to make it visible

```
-- human.rs
    -- head.rs
    -- head
        -- eyes.rs
        -- nose.rs
        mouth.rs
    -- upperbody.rs
    -- upperbody
        -- chest.rs
        -- stomach.rs
    -- lowerbody.rs
    -- lowerbody
        -- legs.rs
        -- mod.rs
```

-   Modules can also be declared by a file `mod.rs` in a folder and the compiler will look in the `folder/mod.rs` file to use as contents for the module declaration of `folder`

```
-- human.rs
    -- head.rs
    -- head
        -- eyes.rs
        -- nose.rs
        -- mouth.rs
        -- mod.rs
    -- upperbody
        -- chest.rs
        -- stomach.rs
        -- mod.rs
    -- lowerbody
        -- legs.rs
        -- mod.rs
```
